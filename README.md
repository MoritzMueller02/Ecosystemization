I created this project within the scope of my work at the Research Training Group at the University of Passau and for my bachelor thesis. 

This project is about identifying ecosystem oriented companies using supervised learning, and financial and business ecosystem metrics gathered from 10Ks of all S&P1500
companies ranging from 2008 - 2023. 

In total I trained 7 supervised models. 

This project was / is still mnominated for the German Research Price Business/Economics (for Bachelor Students of course)
